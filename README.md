# style-gan
## This repository explains implementation of style gan 
###### run the style gan encoder notebook first. follow the steps, download the output vectors.npy and then run the second notebook.
###### I learned all the maths behind this code from https://www.youtube.com/user/kumarahlad professor Ahlad Kumar on youtube. He has an illustrative lecture series on Gans and he also teaches how to code the same. 
###### After going through the playlist I was able to code the same easily.
###### For proper understanding you can also go through my blogs on https://abhishek-parashar.github.io/. I write about Deep Learning, Machine learning, GANs and some random stuff. 
###### Feel free to suggest new topics for blogs or if you find a problem in any of the repositories raise an issue. I would do my best to resolve that at the earliest.
